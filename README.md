# Bouncing Ball Playground

## About
This is a tiny creative-coding playground built as a **single HTML file**.

Your canvas is a single ball bouncing under the effect of gravity.
The goal of this project is not complexity, but experimentation.

Make it prettier, stranger, scarier, or more playful.
Add colors, trails, effects, controls, or entirely change how it feels.
Feel free to modify the code in any way.

This repository is meant for practicing:
- basic HTML
- basic JavaScript
- simple physics
- Git & GitHub workflows (commits, branches, PRs)

---

## How to run
There is **no setup** and **no dependencies**.

Just open the file:
```text
index.html

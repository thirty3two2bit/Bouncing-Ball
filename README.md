# Bouncing Ball

## About
I’m building a tiny interactive art playground and I’d love to see your creativity on top of a simple base.

Your canvas is a single ball bouncing under gravity inside a box. Make it prettier, weirder, scarier—anything you like.
Add trails, particles, colors, sound, controls, obstacles, or entirely change the vibe. Feel free to experiment with the code as needed.

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

Tip: For a local server (optional):
- VS Code → “Live Server” extension
- or `python -m http.server` and open the shown URL

## Controls
- Click: move ball + random kick
- R: reset
- P: pause
- Arrow Up/Down: gravity
- Arrow Left/Right: bounciness (restitution)

## Ideas for features (pick one!)
- Add a trail effect (fade the previous frames)
- Add particles on impact
- Add sliders for gravity and bounciness
- Add obstacles/platforms
- Add sound on bounce (with a mute toggle)
- Add themes (dark / neon / pastel)
- Add multiple balls
